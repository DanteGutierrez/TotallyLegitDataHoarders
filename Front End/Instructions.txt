To get the front end running, first you need to verify you have Node.js

To verify, run the command: npm -version

If there is an error saying npm is not defined, you need to go and download / install npm on your machine.

If npm gave you a version, then you can open this folder in command line, or else this won't work.

Run the command: npm install

This will download all the missing data you need to run the program.

After that command run: nodemon

This will host the website locally on port 3000, so you now can see the page if you go to: localhost:3000
**DO NOT CLOSE THE COMMAND LINE**

If you try to do anything on the page it won't work because you may not have any data in the mongo database.

After you have your set up mongo database you have to see what port it is running on, default port is 27017,
but yours may be different.

If the port is different you have to go into: Front End > routes > routes.js and edit the
line: const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'; change the port to whatever your mongo is set to.

After that you can un-comment all the commented lines on that file, save it, and reload the webpage on localhost:3000

My script would have generated the data for you to use. After it ran once, you should re-comment
only the lines you un-commented so you aren't re-generating that data, there is nothing wrong with it but it is laggy.

You should be able to run tests and play with the website now.
